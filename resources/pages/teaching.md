No matter your age, learning to play a musical instrument can be a
deeply rewarding experience.  Playing an instrument fosters focus and
dedication, and provides deep personal enrichment. And cello is the
most beautiful instrument of them all!

My primary goal as a teacher is to inspire a love of music in my
students. I always maintain a welcoming, encouraging environment in
lessons.  Even from the very beginnings of learning the instrument, I
emphasize healthy technical habits.  I also teach my beginning
students note reading and the basics of music theory.  I have years of
experience teaching a wide variety of age groups and ability levels.

My teaching studio is located in the Inner Sunset neighborhood of San
Francisco, easily accessible by public transportation or car.  To
